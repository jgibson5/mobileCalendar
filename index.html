        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>It's sometimes hard to know which of the many items
in your to-do list you should do now. This could be because you have
other events coming up you need to attend, and there isn't
time to do the most important things. Instead, you might find yourself
wasting time or doing an unimportant smaller task, when there is something
more important you could have completed if you knew about it.</p>

<p>Certain tasks require more concentration and effort than others. If
at any given time you do not feel up to completing a task that requires
significant focus, you should do the most important thing that requires
the least effort. This type of prioritizing isn't often managed by
todo lists or calendars, and that's one of the major changes we hoped
to have in ours.</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a to-do list that rearranges itself around
a calendar based on the due date and difficulty of each task. In addition,
we wanted to familiarize ourselves with Android APIs, to rethink the
role of the calendar and how mobile devices represent calendars, and
to implement a basic auto-scheduling tool. There are existing to-do
list applications and calendar applications, but nothing that attempts
to integrate the two in a useful manner. We decided that the best
way to achieve our goals in the context of Software Engineering was
to create an Android application.</p>

<p>We chose a paradigm where the application determines importance from
user entry of due date, difficulty level, and amount of time required.
The app returns the list with the to-dos in order of due date and
orders the to-dos for each date from hardest to easiest. The app also
pulls events from the local Android calendar. Based on available blocks
of time, it prioritizes the tasks to fit the available time as shown
in Figures 1-3.</p>

<h1>Walkthrough</h1>

<p>When the user first opens the application, he/she sees the home screen,
which presents two options: create a new to-do list item or view the
to-do list (Figure 1a). If the user presses the "+
New" button, the user are taken to a screen that
allows him or her to enter a new to-do item (Figure 1b). The user
may enter the task's name, due date, required focus
level, and time required for completion. He or she can then save the
item to the phone's internal storage.</p>

<p>After saving the item, the user is taken back to the home screen.
From there, if the user presses the "Todo List"
button, they will be taken to the to-do list view. The user will
then see a list of their to-do items and also the calendar events
for the day. The to-do items are ordered by difficulty and then placed
into the first available time slot between events.</p>

<p>For example, we can see in Figure 1c that there is not enough time
before the next event to complete one of the more difficult tasks,
so the application places three easier tasks in the available times.
The to-do items are color coded according to the perceived difficulty,
with more difficult tasks appearing darker. Events are always colored
white. </p>

<h1>Design Decisions</h1>

<p>Our software design was influenced by the constraints of the Android
API, which enabled us to work within a well defined framework. However,
given project time constraints, we found it easier to create custom
classes than to understand how to use the more complex Android classes.
Our main classes are shown in the UML diagram in Figure 2.</p>

<h2>Activity Classes and Subclasses</h2>

<p>We created three screens as Android activities, which are subclasses
of the Android Activity class: an activity for entering new to-dos,
an activity that displays the list of to-dos and events, and a main
activity which can start the other two.</p>

<h2>ListView and PlaceableListView</h2>

<p>The role of the ListView is to populate the XML such that it displays
on the screen. We created PlaceableListView to enable custom callbacks
if needed for future development.</p>

<h2>ArrayAdapter and PlaceableListViewAdapter</h2>

<p>ArrayAdapter sends the ListView an array of Strings for the ListView
to display using an XML structure. Because the default ArrayAdapter
only uses Strings, we created PlaceableListViewAdapter to use the
ArrayAdapter for Placeables, our custom class for todos and events.</p>

<h2>Todos, Events, and Placeables</h2>

<p>By default, Todos have a specified difficulty level and time required,
but do not include start and end times. However, Events pulled from
the calendar do. To place Todos on a calendar with events, we need
them to have start and end times. Thus we created the class PlacedTodos,
which has a Todo along with start times and duration. Placeables are
an abstract class we made to provide a common interface for PlacedTodos
and Events.</p>

<h2>AvailableTimes</h2>

<p>We created the AvailableTimes class to identify the time slots between
a given list of events for placing Todos and creating associated PlacedTodos.
The TodoListActivity sorts the todo items by priority: first by due
date, and then by difficulty level within each day. It then uses AvailableTimes
to fit the items to the earliest available time slots using a priority
queue. We initially used a linked list of booleans to identify what
15-minute blocks of time were occupied or unoccupied. To save memory,
we switched to <a href="https://github.com/ryla" class="user-mention">@ryla</a>'s BitList class, which stores each boolean as
a bit in a list of integers. </p>

<h2>DateTime</h2>

<p>We made a DateTime class because it was more suitable for interfacing
with the Android calendar API and for processing user input. The class
stores time as milliseconds since the UNIX Epoch. We made parse()
and toString() methods that allowed us to smoothly upgrade from our
original String-based storage and to easily store DateTime in the
database. At first, we were worried that creating DateTime would prove
a waste of valuable time, but it made writing new code based on it
significantly easier.</p>

<h1>Future Development</h1>

<p>Our goal was to create an app that blends todo lists and calendars
in a more useful manner. Per early ideation sessions focused on user
requirements, we identified a set of features that would add the most
value to the application. If we were to continue development, we would
enable the user to edit and remove todo items, add a day view that
shows the events against a constant time scale, and improve the placement
algorithm to include awareness of current location and similarity
of events for grouping. </p>
